# Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz (for Docker)

## I just want to play the game!

Want to play Zork? Easy-peasy. Just type the following:

`docker run -it clockworksoul/zork2`

## What if I want to save my games?

Still pretty easy. All you need to do it volume in a save directory as follows:

`docker run -it -v ~/saves/zork2:/save clockworksoul/zork2`

## Potential terminal issues

If you receive a terminal error, such as `Error opening terminal: rxvt-unicode-256color`, type the following and re-run:

```export TERM=xterm```

## History/Legal
The _Zork_ games were created by the now-defunct [Infocom, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom), the intellectual property of which has since been acquired by Activision. Much of Infocom's library was released for free some 20 years ago as part of a promotional campaign for the graphic adventure _Zork: Grand Inquisitor_.  It's unclear, however, whether these were intended to be permanently and perpetually free or whether this was something with a limited window. While Activision has had nothing to say on the subject, they done nothing to interfere with the numerous sites that have sprung up over the years that allow you to download the games directly or even play in your browser... so interpret that as you will.
