# Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz (for Docker)

Want to play Zork? Easy-peasy. Just type the following:

`docker run -it clockworksoul/zork2`

Enjoy!

History/Legal: The _Zork_ games were created by the now-defunct Infocom, and were released for free some 20 years ago as part of a promotional campaign for the graphic adventure _Zork: Grand Inquisitor_.  It's unclear, however, whether these were intended to be permanently and perpetually free or whether this was something with a limited window. While Activision has had nothing to say on the subject, numerous sites have sprung up over the years that allow you to download the games directly or even play in your browser... so interpret that as you will.
